# solution-book-till-2020
This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from various Online Judges. More than 50 different algorithms and data structures are included.
You can find more detailed explanation for each program on [my old personal website](cnblogs.com/iiyiyi). Note that the blog was written in Chinese while I was still in high school. I plan to translate and transfre all these posts to [my new static website], which currently contains some leetcode problems I have written.
